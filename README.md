# Hand in Period 2

## Node.js, Express + JavaScript Backend Testing, NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

### Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?
### Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat
### Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server.
### Explain briefly how to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:

#### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
#### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
#### Ensure that you can take advantage of a multi-core system
#### Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)

### Explain the difference between “Developer outputs” and application logging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend-code,
